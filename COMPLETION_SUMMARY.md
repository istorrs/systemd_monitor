### How to Use the New Documentation

1. **For Users**: Check `README.md` for updated usage instructions
2. **For Contributors**: Read `CHANGELOG.md` for version history
3. **For Developers**: Review `PR2_ANALYSIS.md` for architecture details
4. **For CI/CD**: GitHub Actions runs automatically on push/PR

### Migration from Old Documentation

The README has been completely rewritten to reflect the current architecture. Key changes:

**Removed:**
- ❌ References to polling-based monitoring
- ❌ DBusMonitor and StatsAnalyzer class descriptions (outdated)
- ❌ SystemdMonitor orchestrator description (old architecture)

**Added:**
- ✅ Event-driven architecture explanation
- ✅ D-Bus callback documentation
- ✅ Persistent state tracking details
- ✅ Pre-commit hook usage
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline information
- ✅ Troubleshooting section
- ✅ Development roadmap

### Key Achievements

🎉 **Complete and accurate documentation** reflecting actual codebase
🎉 **Professional CI/CD pipeline** with comprehensive quality checks
🎉 **Clear migration guides** for existing users
🎉 **Automated quality enforcement** via GitHub Actions
🎉 **Better developer experience** with detailed contributing guides

### Recommendations for Maintainers

1. **Enable GitHub Actions**: The workflow is ready to run on the repository
2. **Create Codecov Account**: For coverage reporting integration
3. **Review and Merge**: All changes are on the feature branch ready for PR
4. **Plan Phase 2**: Start integrating config.py module
5. **Tag a Release**: Consider tagging v2.0.1 with these documentation improvements

### Testing the CI/CD Pipeline

Once merged and Actions enabled:
```bash
# Any push to main will trigger:
- Pylint checks
- Test suite on Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
- Code quality scans
- Security analysis
- Build validation

# All must pass for PR to be mergeable
```
