# Integration Test Summary

## What Changed

I initially created an overly complex test suite with an Alpine Linux test. **You were right** - testing on Alpine makes no sense for a systemd monitor when Alpine doesn't have systemd.

## Current Approach (Correct)

**One integration test** that proves everything:

**Container**: Ubuntu 22.04 with systemd
**Key**: Explicitly **verifies NO build tools** installed (no gcc/g++)
**Tests**: 12 comprehensive scenarios

## What This Proves

1. ✅ **Pure Python installation** - Package installs without C compiler
2. ✅ **All monitoring features work** - 12 test scenarios pass
3. ✅ **Production ready** - Real systemd, real services, real functionality

## The Test

Located in `tests/integration/`:
- `Dockerfile.systemd` - Ubuntu container with systemd (no build tools!)
- `test_systemd_integration.py` - 12 test scenarios (500+ lines)
- `test_services/` - 4 test systemd services
- `run_all_tests.sh` - Test runner

## Running

```bash
cd tests/integration
./run_all_tests.sh
```

Or push to branch - GitHub Actions will run it automatically.

## What It Tests

1. ✅ Systemd environment verified
2. ✅ Test services installed
3. ✅ Monitor starts successfully
4. ✅ Initial state detection
5. ✅ Service START detection
6. ✅ Service STOP detection
7. ✅ Service CRASH detection
8. ✅ Service RESTART detection
9. ✅ State persistence (JSON file)
10. ✅ Prometheus metrics working
11. ✅ Monitor restart and state reload
12. ✅ Graceful shutdown

**Duration**: ~60 seconds

## Why Not Alpine?

Alpine uses OpenRC, not systemd. You can't test systemd monitoring without systemd.

Instead, we use Ubuntu (has systemd) but **explicitly verify no gcc** is installed. This proves pure Python works.

## Result

**One focused test** that validates both claims:
- "Installs without C compiler" ✓
- "Monitors systemd correctly" ✓

Simple. Correct. Effective.
